# Python-job-bot

Job application bot that sends applications on behalf of applicant

Tech used: Python, Selenium, HTML

Process: First I had to make sure I was using good selectors. That sometimes meant using the element's ID attributes and sometimes the XPATH. Next, I focused on the timing between each interaction and making sure elements existed on the page before clicking on them or scrolling to them, etc. After many iterations, it finally worked and performed at high speed (1 application each second)
